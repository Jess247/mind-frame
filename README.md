# Browser extension

This extension is build with React JS and styled with tailwind.
It displays the users location, current weather and the time. Theres a bulid in promodoro timer and a todo list.

This project is a template that's why no data is saved.

The background image is randomly generated through the unsplash API and the weather is getting its data from openweathermap API.
